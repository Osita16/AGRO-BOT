# 🌱 AGRO-BOT | Smart Agriculture Robot

AGRO-BOT is a **smart agriculture robot project** aimed at automating basic farming tasks such as **soil moisture monitoring and irrigation control**.  
This project is built as a **learning + practical robotics project**, combining electronics, embedded programming, and system design.

## 🚜 Project Objectives
- Monitor soil moisture levels
- Automate water pump control based on soil condition
- Reduce water wastage
- Learn real-world embedded system integration

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Soil moisture sensor reads moisture level
2. Data is processed by the microcontroller
3. If moisture is below threshold:
   - Water pump turns ON
4. If moisture is sufficient:
   - Water pump turns OFF

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- IoT dashboard for remote monitoring
- Weather-based irrigation logic
- Mobile app integration
- Solar-powered system
